TO DO:
=> Add some functions
=> Add HELP feature
=> Wrap variables and constants map into a class symbol_table along with its getters and setters and other functions
    (contains get_value(), set_value(), var_table and const_table functions members)
=> Print result on entering '\n' instead of ';'
=> Add commands to the program like quit and help for example
=> Allow the user to declare constants
=> Add an int-only mode where calculations are done only in integers and error is shown from
   overflow and underflow
=> Fix the code for following testcases:
    > 1/4/7/5;

DONE:
=> Variables can now be declared but cannot be used. Allow using the variables in expression. 
=> Reassigning values to already created variables.
=> Add some constants
=> testcases:
    > num;  (shows errors)
